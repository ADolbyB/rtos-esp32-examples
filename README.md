# FreeRTOS examples with ESP32 

These are practice examples for ESP32 FreeRTOS with VS Code and PlatformIO, using the Arduino Framework.

What is FreeRTOS? It's a Free Real Time Operating System for embedded devices written in C++.

The ESP32 uses a modified version which can perform Symmetrical Multicore Processing (SMP).

The ESP32 specific version is referred to as ESP-IDF (IoT Development Framework) and has some extra custom API Functions.

Read the Vanilla FreeRTOS [Documentation](https://freertos.org/RTOS.html).

Read the [ESP32 Arduino Core Documentation](https://espressif-docs.readthedocs-hosted.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/index.html).

Read the [ESP-IDF Programming Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/index.html).

The board I used for practice is an [ESP32 Thing Plus C](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/18018) from [SparkFun](https://www.sparkfun.com/).

These practice examples follow Shawn Hymel's [Introduction to RTOS](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEBQazB0HUyQ4hAPU1cJED6t3DU0h34bz) playlist on YouTube.
