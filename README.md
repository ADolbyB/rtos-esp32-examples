# RTOS-ESP32-examples

These are practice examples for ESP32 RTOS with VS Code and PlatformIO.

The board I used for practice is an [ESP32 Thing Plus C](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/18018) from [SparkFun](https://www.sparkfun.com/).

These practice examples follow Shawn Hymel's [Introduction to RTOS](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEBQazB0HUyQ4hAPU1cJED6t3DU0h34bz) playlist on YouTube.
